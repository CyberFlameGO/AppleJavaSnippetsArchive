/**
 * Central controller of the application, holds shared resources, and is
 * the arbiter of what the app can and cannot do at any moment.
 * 
 * This example delegates to two controllers: one for the main window,
 * and the other for the address book palette window. These two windows
 * share localized content, common actions, and similar menu bars.
 * 
 * Larger applications should delegate to sub-controllers which manage
 * more specific resources and its related UI. Document-based apps
 * should create a new sub-controller for each open document that manages
 * the document life cycle (unsaved changes, data model, toolbars, etc).
